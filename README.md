# PHYS263 Data & Resources

Data from the 12/6 nuclear lab is in the **lab9** folder.

If you have a Github account, star or 'watch' this repository and I'll give you edit access. Otherwise just email me your data if you want it up here.

In your lab report, please use your own data wherever possible, and give clear credit for any data borrowed from others. Do not post your lab report as this may be cheating.

Feel free to add any resources you find helpful for this class.
